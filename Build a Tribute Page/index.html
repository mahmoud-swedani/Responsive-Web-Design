        In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use
        to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
        First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn 
        modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility
        by building a web form.
        Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter
        card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

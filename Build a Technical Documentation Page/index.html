                        Both quotes represent Strings but be sure to choose one and STICK WITH IT. If you start with a single quote, you need to end with a single quote.
                        There are pros and cons to using both IE single quotes tend to make it easier to
                        write HTML within Javascript as you don‚Äôt have to escape the line with a double quote.

                        In JavaScript, a boolean value is one that can either be TRUE or FALSE. 
                        If you need to know ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù about something, then you would want to use the boolean function. 
                        It sounds extremely simple, but booleans are used all the time in JavaScript programming, 
                        and they are extremely useful. Anything that needs to be ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù, ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù, ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù,
                        or which just has a temporary purpose, is usually a good fit for booleans.
                        Below is an example of how to use booleans in JavaScript:

                    </p>
                    <div class="code-div">
                        <code class="code">
                            var kitchenLights = false;<br>
                            kitchenLights = true;<br>
                            kitchenLights;<br>
                            OUTPUT<br>
                            true
                        </code>
                    </div>

                    <p class="p">
                        In this example, the variable "kitchenLights" being set to "true" would indicate that the lights are on.
                        If it was set to "false" then that would mean they are off. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="lists">
                        <ul class="ul-list">
                            <li class="link-list">It‚Äôs useful to store booleans in variables to keep track of their values and change them over time. Booleans are used as functions to get the values of variables, objects, conditions, and expressions. In fact, Booleans are critical for conditionals to work. </li>
                            <li class="link-list">In your code, when you need to know whether or not a condition is being met before proceeding to the next step, the boolean function becomes your best friend. If such and such is TRUE, then do this. If it is FALSE, then do something else.

                            </li>
                            <li class="link-list">Consider something simple like making a sandwich. In your head, you will actually be going through a series of booleans and conditionals:

                            </li>
                            <li class="link-list">Do I have bread? TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, then I can proceed to the next step of whether or not I have mustard, ham, etc. If FALSE, then I‚Äôll need to go to the store to get some bread. And so on and so forth.

                            </li>
                            <li class="link-list">You can never assume anything when programming - you have to write the logic explicitly, and a large part of that is simply knowing whether or not a condition is being met. Hence the importance of booleans in JavaScript.

                        <strong>JavaScript functions</strong> are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, taking some 
                        form of input and returning an output.
                        To define a function, you must use the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ( ).
                        Then you have to write the function logic between curly brackets { }
                        <br>Here is an example of how to write a function in JavaScript:

                                return x + y;<br>

                        avaScript objects are best explained by thinking of a real-world object. Take a car for example.
                        Cars come in all shapes and sizes - different colors, different makes and models, different weight, etc. 
                        Every car has these properties, but the values are different from one car to another. A red Ford Focus and a blue Honda
                        Civic are both ‚Äúcars‚Äù, but they are different makes, models, and colors. <br>
                        JavaScript objects are variables that contain multiple data values. The values within a JS
                        object are known as properties. Objects use keys to name values, much like how is done with variables. <br>                    
                        Let‚Äôs look at another example. This time let‚Äôs think about a course you have to take. The course name is ‚ÄúGRA 2032‚Äù,
                        it starts at 8:00am and it ends at 10:00am. Here‚Äôs how we would turn this into an object in JavaScript:

                                name: "GRA 2032",<br>

                        JavaScript object values are written in the format of name:value and the different pairs are separated by commas. 
                        The name:value pairs don‚Äôt have to be on different lines for the code to work, but it is much easier to read and understand
                        the code by formatting it that way. You must also use the opening and closing curly brackets { } when defining your objects <br>
                        There are two ways to access the value of an object property. 
                        You can use the dot notation with the name of the property after the period
                        - objectName.propertyName as in the example below:
                    </p>

                            <li class="link-list">Or you can use the bracket notation with the name of the property inside a string within square brackets - objectName[‚ÄúpropertyName‚Äù] as in the example below:

                            </li>
                            <li class="link-list">To change the value of a property on an existing JS object, you can use a very similar option as when you access the value. You can use the dot notation:

                            <li class="link-list">Or the bracket notation:

                            <li class="link-list">Objects can also contain functions, which are called methods. Methods are just the word for functions when they are stored as a property within a JavaScript object. For example, if you have a ‚Äúperson‚Äù object, with the properties of ‚ÄúfirstName‚Äù and  ‚ÄúlastName‚Äù, but you want a property for ‚ÄúfullName‚Äù, you can create a method that will add the first name and the last name together for you and return the full name as a property. See the example below:

                            </li>
                            <li class="link-list">You can access a method in a very similar way to accessing the other properties - objectName.methodName()    i.e. person.fullName()
